Hello!!!
I am very interested in game development and 
I am learning things about others things here and there,
I'm currently developing a 3D game, this will take awhile, 
but I am having so much fun and learning along the way!

I am using this as a hub for my projects, I do not expect people to hop in

Its not exactly a secure way of private communication, though its a nice place to chat.
